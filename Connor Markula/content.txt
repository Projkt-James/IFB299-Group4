Work I have done this releses include:

The organisation of JIRA, During the weeks I Have update Jira on a daily basis, This can be a lot of work on its own as many 
of the user storys need to be updated on a daily and weekly basis.


The user storys have been updated to meet standards, giving a more clear understanding of the users of the website.


I have Developed the spirit 3 Burn down chart, This can be a challaging process as everything in jira needs to be 
fully orgainze to have the burn down chart to record accurately. 

I have also developed the spirit 4 burn down chart.

And Spirit 1 and 2 burn down.
