Su Yatti Moe Zin @ Rachel's Porfolio 2

In my porfolio 2, I finalised the release and sprint plan. In that report, all the completed user stories are recorded according to the sprint schedules. 
In the file name called 'List of user stories', I made a completely new document which contains the user stories ordered by sprint priority. 
In the 'Acceptance Criteria' document, there are expected and unexpected outcomes listed i.e. alternative path and so on. 
I produced a usabilty testing which is set up in a way that I give the user a scenerio and watch her doing the tasks. I used the contextual inquiry method to get feedback from the user. 
Finally, in the testing report,I made different testings such as functionality testing, compatibility testing and so on. 
The testing checklist is just to check the general functionality of the website. 

All uploaded in the Git. 

*** The file name 'Prototype' was uploaded in porfolio 1 however, i didnt save it as a PDF so it was not viewable. So i uploaded it again in my portfolio 2. ***

Thank you!
